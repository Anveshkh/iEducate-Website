            Hot exhaust gas of about 800 degree c along with sound waves generated at the end of exhaust is sent to Catalytic convertor through the exhaust valve.
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Catalytic convertor is the most expensive part of the exhaust system. Due to partial combustion the gases entering inside the catalytic convertor consists of mixture of carbon monoxide , unburned Hydrocarbon or fuel and oxides fo Nitrogen which are more harmful to environment</p>
          <br>
          <p>It is expensive because there are two ceramic blocks. One block consists of platinum and Rhodium while other block consits of platinum and palladium.  </p>
          <br>
          <P>The main function of catalytic convertor is to convert these harmful gases into carbondioxide , water and nitrogen.</P>
          <br>
          <p>Before and after entering the catalytic convertor oxygen sensors checks the oxygen level. As inside the catalytic convertor harmful gases are converted into less harmful gases like co2, water and nitrogen thus oxygen is required inside. Thus if reading of both the oxygen sensors is same it means that catalytic convertor has Malfunctioned and needs checking. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The exhaust gas now becomes less toxic but consists of sound waves generated by the engine . The gas now passes to the Muffler.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag">
          The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
          documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
          documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
          web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
          of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
          With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
          forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
          create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
          such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
          HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
          Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such
          as surround and provide information about document text and may
          include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML
          tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

        <p class="sectionSubTag">
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
          such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
          Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the
          separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
          fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide
          more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
          characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
          specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
          complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
          .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
          pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting
          and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
          different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
          in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
          Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
          formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

        <p class="sectionTag">JavaScript</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">
          JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one
          of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
          CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
          web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13]
          All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
          the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often
          just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
          standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
          supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
          styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
          with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
          the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
          include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
          graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime
          system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were
          originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of
          some servers and a variety of applications.
